        This is an optional function to be used to clean up memory / data
         structures / etc. when an order_chain is done with.

        The idea is that when a user of the metrics is done with the data for a
         given order_chain, it can call "clean_up" on the listeners and data that
         is no longer needed can be deleted.

        If this function is called before all uses of the OrderEventListener
         are done with the order chain then those uses won't be able to get the
         needed data.

        If a listener tracks data by subchain_id then the cleanup will need to
         go through all subchains in the order chain and do cleanup for each one.

        If an inheritng class of OrderEventListener does not implement this
         function then simply nothing is done to do the clean up.
