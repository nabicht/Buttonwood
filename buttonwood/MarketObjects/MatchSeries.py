class MatchSeries(object):
    """
    A match series is a series of fills on both sides of the book that make up one match from one aggressing order.
    
    For example, a 20 lot buy could cross into the offer and match with 4 other resting orders. This class tracks 
     bundles all the resulting fills into one series of matches.
     
    MatchSeries has no requirement that the all the resulting fills are perfectly symmetric because not all venues 
     return symmetric fills. For the above example, one venue might return:
       * Buy 20
       * Sell 7
       * Sell 3
       * Sell 4
       * Sell 6
       
     While another venue returns:
       * Buy 7
       * Buy 3
       * Buy 4
       * Buy 6
       * Sell 7
       * Sell 3
       * Sell 4
       * Sell 6
     
     The only requirement when sanity checks are run on the MatchSeries is that the total size per price are equal
      on both sides of the match.
      
     Also, it uses internal functions for checking that they all equal get_buys(price) get_sells(price) to do the 
      checks. This let's people overwrite those functions in order to have "fuzzy matches" across asset classes or
      products
    
    Match time (timestamp) is time of first fill.
