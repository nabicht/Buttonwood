        A price level is one price of one side of a book. It summarizes all the basic data found at that price, including
         the price itself, the visible qty, the hidden qty, and the number of orders. Hidden Qty is optional as many
         markets don't have it as an option. And number of orders is optional because based on the market that's data is
         being processed you might not have knowledge of number of orders.
  
         Visible Qty must be greater than 0 because can't have negative qty and if 0 then shouldn't be a price level.
  
         Hidden Qty must be >=0 because can't have a negative qty at a price level.
  
         Number of orders must be >= visible qty + hidden_qty because smallest size per order is 1 so can't have more
          orders than qty.
  
         If number of orders is defined then it has to be > 0 as can't be negative and 0 would mean no price level.
