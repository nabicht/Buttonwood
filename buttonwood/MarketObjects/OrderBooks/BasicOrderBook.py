class BasicOrderBook(object):

    """
    BasicOrderBook includes the base functions for querying an order book,
     no matter the type of order book (price level, order level, or
     otherwise).

    As many of the functions are implemented as can be, and those that aren't
     (as indicate by raising a NotImplemented exception) need to be implemented
     by the inhereting class.

    The inhereting class is also responsible for creating and maintaining the
     underlying data structures as well as the functions (internal and exposed)
     that allow for the manipulation of that structure.

        """
        Get the last "market time" the order book was updated.

        Order books should be thought of as living breathing things that update
         when new information is applied, so knowing when the last update
         occurred is important.

        "Market Time" vs "clock time".
         Market Time is the time of the market, which is time that comes from
          the market messages.
         Clock time is the time of the server if one called a system call to get
          the current time.
         The last update time is market time and *not* clock time. Using Market
          Time throughout allows for analytics to be done on historical data
          and on live data removes the issue of transport time and queues
          throwing off the deltas between updates.

        The time that gets returned is microseconds since the epoch in seconds
         notation, where to the left of the decimal is an integer and to the
         right of the decimal is the microseconds
